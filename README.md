```
public class Program {
    public static int max(int[] values) {
        
        int currentMax = values[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < values.length; i++) {
            if (currentMax < values[i]) {
                currentMax = values[i];
            }
        }
        return currentMax;
    }
	public static void main(String[] args) {
	    int[] values = {1,2,2,3,4,6,2,45,54,52,3};
	    for (int i = 0; i < values.length; i++) {
	        System.out.println(values[i]);

## 2020/07/13
Today I opened(literally) my old laptop and removed the battery, RAM, HDD and broke the CPU accidentally(Who cares because it's pentium).

## 2020/07/10
The weather was nice today. I have finished all my homework 📚 today.

## 2020/07/09

## 2020/07/08
I forgot to upload my blog yesterday. But today, I will upload a python challenge from w3resource. I solved the problem below by the code below the challenge.

### Question: Write a python program to check if a given positive integer is a power of four.

```
number = int(input("What number do you chose?: "))
i = 0
while 4**i < number + 1:

    if 4**i == number:
        print("Yes")
    else:
        print("No")
    
    i += 1
```

![My turtle picture 1](.\Turtle_picture_1.png)

This picture was created by the turtle function of Python. The code is as follows:

```
import turtle
t = turtle.Turtle()
s = turtle.getscreen()
t.speed(0)
t.shape("turtle")
s.bgcolor("pink")
s.tracer(0)
for i in range(100):
    t.color("blue")
    t.fd(57)
    t.left(46)
    t.color("red")
    t.fd(34)
    t.setpos(0,2)
    t.circle(50)
turtle.done()

```

Today I met my friends and had a farewell party for a friend.

## 2020/07/04 

Today, finally the weather is nice and sunny.

## 2020/07/03

Today my Airpods Pro arrived from Korea.

## 2020/07/02

Today the weather was cloudy and dark. 

## 2020/07/01

Today in my lesson, I learned about the define function. I could define my own commands and use them; for instance:

```
def rectangle_area_calculator(width,height):

    area = height*width

    print(area)

    return area
```

## 2020/06/30

Today the weather was nice. I had a nice day.


## 2020/06/29
```
n = 30

number = n

for i in range(1,31):

    if i%3 == 0 and i%5 == 0:

        print("Fizz Buzz")

    elif i%3 == 0:

        print("Fizz")

    elif i%5 == 0:

        print("Buzz")

    else:

        print(i)
```

This is my Fizz Buzz program. When a number is a multiple of 3, the program prints Fizz. When a number is a multiple of 5, the program prints Buzz. When a number is both a multiple of 3 and 5, the program prints Fizz Buzz. However, when a number is nor a multiple of 3 and 5, the program prints the number.
