Today I met my friends and had a farewell party for a friend.

## 2020/07/04 

Today, finally the weather is nice and sunny.

## 2020/07/03

Today my Airpods Pro arrived from Korea.

## 2020/07/02

Today the weather was cloudy and dark.

Today in my lesson, I learned about the define function. I could define my own commands and use them; for instance:

```
def rectangle_area_calculator(width,height):

    area = height*width

    print(area)

    return area
```

Today the weather was nice. I had a nice day.

```
n = 30

number = n

for i in range(1,31):

    if i%3 == 0 and i%5 == 0:

        print("Fizz Buzz")

    elif i%3 == 0:

        print("Fizz")

    elif i%5 == 0:

        print("Buzz")

    else:

        print(i)
```

This is my Fizz Buzz program. When a number is a multiple of 3, the program prints Fizz. When a number is a multiple of 5, the program prints Buzz. When a number is both a multiple of 3 and 5, the program prints Fizz Buzz. However, when a number is nor a multiple of 3 and 5, the program prints the number.
